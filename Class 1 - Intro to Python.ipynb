You will learn how to combine datasets, calculate aggregated values, remove bad data, and create visuals. We are going to be using the Pandas library built for Python. This lesson focuses on some basic python syntax that will be universal about most functions you need to perform within python. We assume minimal prior knowledge of programming or Python syntax.\n",

    "A critical function of any script or workflow is the ability to save information for later use. The most common way to do this is by the use of **variables**. In python the we use the equals (`=`) operator, with the variable name on the left, and the value on the right. See below for an example below. Saving a value to a variable name like this allows us to modify, reference, and use the value in a later section of the code. "

The `elif` keyword allows for an alternate condition to be checked after the first condition returns false, without nesting those conditions within an `else` statement. The boolean value should follow the keyword, just like with if statements. Multiple `elif` statements can be used, but note that the order of the `if` and `elif` checks are important. When one is found to be true, all other checks will be skipped and ignored. \n",

Commonly, iterators will be in the form of lists, dictionaries, pandas columns, dataframe rows, numpy arrays, or even specific functions like `range`. When used in a `for` loop, all code following the semi-colon will be executed with subsequent values of the iterator. In the above, we see that the `print` statement puts one value from `sepal_length` on the screen. specifically, it does so in the order present in `sepal_length`.

    "Most of the syntax is identical to that of a `for` loop, with the primary difference being that instead of passing in a variable and an iterator, we provide a boolean statement. In this case we are passing in `x < 10`. Given the context of the code within the for loop, we know that `x` will approach 10 with each iteration. The conditition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and if the value of the boolean statement is `True`, then the iteration will execute. When (or if) the iteration ever reaches `False`, no more loops will be executed. This can create 2 unexpected situations if the logic is not written correctly. \n",
    "1. Providing statements that are always `False` on the first check. This basically turns your code into an `if` statement. This will depend on the context and the code provided before the while loop.\n",
    "2. Providing statements that are always `True`. This could be providing a statement like `x > 0 or x < 10`. Assuming `x` is a number, this boolean statement ultimately translates to \"is x a number\". Another bug that could cause this by checking a logical statement that never changes. In the example above, failing to increase the value of in the line `x += 1`, x will never reach 10, therefore, will never stop the loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Note\n",
    "Technically, both types of loops perform the exact same function. The only difference is exactly how the iterations are defined. In `while` loops, we define the exit condition with that boolean value, and in `for` loops, we define the iterator object that is being used. In most data analysis tasks, `for` loops are going to be most commonly used due to the fact that the dataset (and therefore the number of iterations, and what we need to iterate over) is defined at the beginning of the script. You can do all this with a while loop, however, the `for` loop is a bit more efficent and is easier to read. "
