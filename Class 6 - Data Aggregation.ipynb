    "Data enrichment and data aggregation are the processes involved around joining merging datasets, creating new columns, calculating values on certain windows, grouping into bins, or even changing the values. All of these processes will assist in the data analysis by providing specific insight into the data. Things such as severity of anomalous data, rolling averages, cumulative sums, or quantities grouped by ages can all make the data easier to interpret. We'll focus on the following for this class:\n",

    "- `join`: A join combines columns of one dataset to the columns of another dataset based on some condition on the row. If the condition is meet, the columns from dataset B are attached to dataset A. \n",

    "### Joining Datasets\n",
    "So far in this class, we have only worked with a single dataset. Joins provide us the ability to take two separate tables or dataframes with related information, and combine them into a single table. For the weather data we've been using, we might perform a join to attach a physical location to the weather measurements using the weather station's id to gain a better idea of how the weather patterns are distributed.\n",

    "- Left (Right) joins return all of the rows from the left (right) dataframe, leaving all the values as null or missing (depending on your language) for the columns from the right (left) table if there was no matching ID found in that table\n",
    "- Full or Outer joins return all rows from both tables, leaving missing values in the columns on both sides for missing IDs in either table (Think the left and right joins happening at the same time)\n",
    "\n",

This referes to the process of taking the data and rolling it up into a single value or set of values instead of looking at the individual measurements.

Sometimes, we want to know the maximum or the average of an entire column, but it can be just as interesting to know the rolling average of some sort of data. Window functions allow us to perform calculations on a group of rows that are close to each other in some way. Using the weather data, we can calculate the average rainfall over the past week. Using the method `rolling`, we can include a predefined set of values in our calculation. In this example, we compute the rolling average of rainfall over the last 7 days at a specific station. "
