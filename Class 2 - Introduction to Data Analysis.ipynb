    "# Introduction to Data Analysis\n",
    "Data Analysis is loosely defined as the process of taking data and turning it into some useful information which enables data-driven decision-making. A skilled data analyst can  \n",
    "- gather data from a wide variety of sources\n",
    "- combine different data sets into a common dataset\n",
    "- clean the data of bad observations\n",
    "- take into account outliers and know when to ignore them\n",
    "- communicate with decision makers to discover business needs and data owners to understand nuances of the data set\n",
    "- provide aggregated metrics and graphics to showcase collected data \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we attempt to teach the basics of the above-mentioned skills. However, the tools used to perform these tasks vary widely from individual packages within a programming language, to entire frameworks that integrate multiple technologies together. The exact selection used will depend on your workflow, business needs, and available software. We focus on the Pandas library for Python for 2 major reasons: \n",
    "1. Python is open-source and completely free to use. Anyone can download it, write some code, and start a workflow without being charged a dime. Additionally, Python has a vast community of users, meaning it is very easy to obtain help from other users and find teaching resources (though books, classes, or video courses). \n",
    "2. Pandas strength lies in its `DataFrame` class. These act like excel or SQL tables that you can use to build graphs, combine datasets, compute metrics, or extract individual observations. This reduces the complexity of the tasks we explore and increases visibility into the actual processes as they happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will focus on some of the most fundamental tasks needed for Data Analysis. Specifically, we will \n",
    "1. collect a dataset,\n",
    "2. read that dataset into python, \n",
    "3. perform some basic manipulation,\n",
    "4. and plot a basic graphic, \n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamentals of Data analysis\n",
    "The following diagram depicts a common workflow for data analysis.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take these nodes and discuss what each means. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "The first step in any data analysis process should be data collection. There are many sources from which to collect data. These different sources will also take different formats. Some questions you will have to ask yourself are \n",
    "- What questions am I trying to answer? \n",
    "- How was the data collected? \n",
    "- What kind of changes need to be made to fit my needs?\n",
    "- Do I need to combine the multiple datasets to get a fuller picture?\n",
    "- Who has the data that can answers those questions?\n",
    "- How do I access the data? \n",
    "- Are there any rules tied to the data that I need to follow?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a small sampling of some important questions that you may need to ask before starting your project. Ensuring that these questions (and potentially many others) will guide the project as a while. This will determine what resources are available, which datasets can be used, and will help avoid running into last minute snags that could put a deadline at risk. Once these questions have been answered, we can start gathering the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common data sources include databases, flat files (think csv or excel files), APIs, and web pages. Python has a variety of libraries available to access each of these formats, with some of them overlapping to a degree. \n",
    "- Databases can be accessed either by some specific driver for that database or by a package that connects to all databases like SQLAlchemy. This package may require that you install other packages as you connect to specific databases, but the error messages you get will specify what else you need. \n",
    "- When dealing with flat files, Pandas is likely your best option, however it can also read data in from databases. This functionality depends on SQLAlchemy, but is a bit more specific to just reading data, whereas SQLAlchemy can perform all database actions (including table creation or deletion, inserting or updating data, in addition to executing queries or stored procedures). These other tasks may be critical to a data analysis workflow, however, this is well beyond the scope of this course.\n",
    "- For API's and web pages, python ships with a package called `requests` to perform HTTP calls, though others have been created. An example could be gathering cryptocurrency prices from [CoinCap](https://docs.coincap.io/) through a api call like [this one](https://api.coincap.io/v2/assets). Querying this API returns a JSON formatted string that you could store into a pandas dataframe to then filter, aggregate, or generate other metrics. Another way of using `requests` would be to read in a html page which contains an embedded table, which can be parsed out and stored to a dataframe, just like the the json string from the previous example. \n",
    "\n",

You will likely have to do some reformatting, filtering, or aggregating to get the data to a state in which is ready to be used for your specific use case. Remember that someone else has likely gathered the data (especially when working at Summit) and had different needs when they gathered the data. \n",

Unconventional formats may have been used even if the data is correct. All of these things need to be corrected or standardized. \n",

    "While each graph is much easier to read, we have still run into some other issues. Notice that the graphs for North Carolina are significantly higher than that of Utah. I want to point out again the scales on on the Y-Axis again. Placing these two graphs side now seems to imply that the number of cases and deaths are rising at similar rates, even though the numbers are clearly printed on the sides. While graphs can offer a very quick and intuitive sense of what the data is doing, you (as a data analyst or presenter) must be causious about what the picture is saying about your data. You can very quickly lead others (or even yourself) to certain conclusions that may not be completely acurate, even though the numbers themselves are true. \n",

    "Unfortunitely most of the work around data analysis will involve iterating over the data, preparing it before you can really do anything with it. Following the 80-20 rule that seems to loom over all that what we do, 80% of the work will be the preperation, and the last 20% will be the good stuff, where you can actually start to learn things about the data. Pandas is an exceptional tool in helping that first 80% run a little bit smoother. "
