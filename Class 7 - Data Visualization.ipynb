    "# Class 7 - Data Visualization and Plotting\n",
    "Data visualization is an extremely useful tool in both analysing the data and in presenting the findings. Humans are visual creatures, and we try to pick out patterns from the things we observe. Luckily, Python has many libraries that make plotting a very easy process. The most popular libraries used in data analysis include\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `seaborn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `pandas` (the same library we have been using for the entire class) and `seaborn` are built on top of the library `matplotlib`. The plotting functions for `pandas` are built in as methods for the data frame itself, but uses the assumption of multiple columns to quicly build visuals that include multiple lines or bars. `Seaborn` is a wrapper around `matplotlib` which provides some defaults and presets that quickly get you to presentaiton ready graphics without much effort. `Matplotlib` provides the most fine-tuned and detailed control of the figures, however requires much more specificity when generating graphics that are ready for presentation.  \n",

    "We will focus on the `matplotlib` and `pandas` for this course. \n",

    "## Matplotlib\n",
    "`Matplotlib` is a library of plotting functions that includes a wide array of possible capabilities. I encurage the reader to look into those functions as needed, but for the scope of this course, we will focus on the `pyplot` package. Let's import that with the traditional alias `plt`. While we're at it, let's go ahead and read in some stock data for Facebook in 2018."
